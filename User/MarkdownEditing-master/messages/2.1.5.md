# MarkdownEditing 2.1.5 Changelog

Your _MarkdownEditing_ plugin is updated. Enjoy new version. For any type of
feedback you can use [GitHub issues][issues].

## Bug Fixes

*   "Insert References" commands get fixed. Select something and press `alt+ctrl+r`
    to try `insert_named_reference` command, and `super+ctrl+shift+r` to try
    `insert_numbered_reference`.
*  Fix an issue that Sublime Text may freeze when searching in a large project.

## New Features

*   Four new commands added to command pallete (`Paste as Link`, `Paste as Reference`,
    `Insert Named Reference`, `Insert Numbered Reference`).
*   New command: `Paste as Inline Link`.
*   New command: `Paste as Inline Image`, `Paste as Image`.
*   Increment link reference defition on <kbd>Enter</kbd> (e.g. `[27]: http://www.example.org`).

## Changes

*   `Paste As Reference` works differently now. Depending on whether the clipboard
    content is a valid URL, `super+ctrl+r` generates a reference on your selection
    with clipboard content as URL link or link name.
*   `Insert Footnote` (`alt+shift+6`) now uses selected words (if any) as footnote
    marker name instead of number.
*   Removed `Insert Named Reference` command, you are encouraged to use
    `Paste as Reference` instead.
*   Space between two link parts will not be highlighted.
